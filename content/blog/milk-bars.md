last week i was a week on holiday in beautiful poland, the country i've visited most during holidays. poland at first seems to sound like a poor country, which in some sense is true but not always! 

i've stayed for a week in warsaw and had a great time. met some internet friends that i've known for years now (even though we didn't talk so much at all lately) and it was really great to see them irl for the first time. i've never had an awkward first meet in my life with internet friends \*knocks on wood\* 

i also got to know something called "milk bars", or in polish "bar mleczny". they are some kind of restaurants and they don't really have to anything with milk (or at least not anymore?)

milk bars are cheap restaurants where you can get your stomach full for a better price. the restaurant itself is very simple and sober, just some tables and chairs. 

i've had some pierogi (dumplings), kompot (some kind of juice) and a soup for the price of  7 euros!! incredibly yummy.

definitely recommend visiting one during your trip to poland :-)
