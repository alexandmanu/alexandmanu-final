some weeks ago, on a friday, i decided to have a drink with some colleagues. let's say every 2 months on a friday, some colleagues gather together in a cafe nearby and they talk about anything else besides work. it's just a fun time, you know? 

i decided to come with, for the first time and i was a little shy at first because i was one of the first to arrive and i wasn't there with my closest colleagues. anyways, some beers in and my closer colleagues had arrived and we had a very good time just talking about anything honestly. at that time we were still outside standing in a circle and people were giving each other rounds üçªüçª. 

then i gave a round as well, because why not? time passes, it's getting colder and we're moving inside. me, being tipsy, i start talking to colleagues i've barely spoken before and everything went well... until suddenly shots are given around. (still no clue from who those were)

and that's where the lights went out for me, i was black out drunk. the very last thing i remember from being there, is my colleagues telling me everything will be okay and when i opened my eyes, i was laying in my bed. 

my heart was racing because i was so confused because: how did i get home?! 
afterwards i hear i was brought home by taxi (which my colleagues paid for and i paid them back later) and my mom had to bring me upstairs (we still didnt talk about that).

moral of the story: drink enough, but not too much.

not sure if i'll be joining the next drink in a couple of weeks..
