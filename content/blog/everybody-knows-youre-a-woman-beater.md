yesterday, a friend of mine (we’ll call her G) told our group she has a friend (we will call her V) who recently broke up with her long term boyfriend. whenever someone breaks up we expect the usual: either they go on with their life or they go crazy. in this instance, my friend was telling us this girl went crazy.

that’s expected and no one should give you shit for it.

now, this our friend told us that this girl was seeing a guy. it’s a guy i somewhat know from middle school, i must have spoken to him a few times. then all of a sudden another friend said: “wait is that the guy who beat X (another girl) in a parking lot?”

all of a sudden i got this flashback as he said that. 3-4 years ago this guy was basically the talk of the town because everyone said he was a woman beater and allegedly he beat 2 of his exes: the parking lot incident was serious as the girl was almost strangled and she pressed charges. 

now, again, all of us agreed on the fact that V has gone really crazy. but how crazy do you need to be to go out with a guy who has a reputation of being a WOMAN BEATER? especially given everything we’ve heard about this last year (tons of women were killed here), I really don’t understand how someone does that. 

G then told us she was a bit scared for V, that she was trying to tell her to just ditch this guy. V simply said “I asked him if the rumors about him are true, he said no”. well what he was gonna say? “yes I’m a woman beater”?? 

what gets me the most is that this isn’t just simple gossip, this is a really serious allegation, it’s not everyday that someone gets accused of being a woman beater. and the girl literally pressed charges, again it's just not a random rumor.

well in the end maybe people just choose to believe what’s convenient for them.. and when something happens, its always “why didn’t anyone say anything?” well we did. we’re saying it now: everybody knows you’re a woman beater
