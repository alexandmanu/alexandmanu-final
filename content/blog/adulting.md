this morning I went out with a friend to get a coffee and some gym clothing. we randomly discussed about adulting as a whole and came up with the following three categories of adults (young adults?):

1. the students: most common one I'd say, but this moreso is about the students who are in their late 20s. they clearly are adults all in all but they still haven't been kicked in the ass by work and life as a whole. I imagine them having a nice life supported by mommy and daddy.
2. the workers: aka the sufferers. it's even tougher when they are still in the early stages of their career (or generally just starting a job) as the nostalgia, at least for me, hits hard when thinking about the carefree life I had before.
3. the overwhelmed: people who work and study (full time) because they're poor. can't fanthom how they manage to do that. just crazy

and I am the worker :-) making solutions, that is what work is, and don’t we LOVE work (!!) :-) :-)

after all of this we agreed that workers have a nice contrast: the ability to spend your money however you want. hence why I went out this morning! i hopped in my car and off i went with my friend to action (it's a store that is kind of the upgrade to the tiger store but without a fuckton of the useless crap). i didn't find any gym shorts which i was hoping for  but i did take some batteries and a body razor. i do already have a face razor, i never bought a body razor or blades as i didn't think i need it: i grow very little hair, but seeing all the gym people with legs smooth as butter kind of made me have a crashout. so now to feel a real productive member of society and the gym™, i want extra smooth legs too

\#i will get smooth legs #thanks for making me feel less
