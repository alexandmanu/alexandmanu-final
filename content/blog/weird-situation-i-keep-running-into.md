hello, I contemplated a lot whether to talk or not talk about this but I feel like I should as this may also help me clear my mind. in order to do this, I need to give a bit of an introduction first.

in italy, when you sign up for high school, you can choose from a variety of schools in a specific field (classical/literature school, cooking school, technical school etc.). I initially went for classical school, and that same first year I switched to a technical school (computer science-like).

now, technical schools in italy are like animal zoos, and what I mean by that is that it’s full of people who go there just to be on their phones, run around and practically do nothing at all (and it’s a shame really, because in my opinion it’s a really good school!).

this introduction is needed as you have to understand that professors there are a hit or miss: either they love what they do and try to spread their passion to other students or either they have lost faith in that system, as the people who go there are mostly disinterested in everything.

I was a very polite kid, I did run around too and had tons of fun but I knew how to treat professors, and while I wasn’t the most diligent student, I just generally knew how to do the least with the highest result (with some exceptions included like math and history which I hated).

my modus operandi was basically like this: I wouldn’t study anything for the entire year (in Italy, the school system is based on planned oral and written exams called interrogazioni, where a student is called to answer questions in front of the class), except for when I knew I would be next in line or when a teacher had already told me in advance. this always worked wonders.

as a result, most of the professors praised me for being a really good student (while in fact not true), I had lots of freedom and I was a point of reference for them.

during my third year (I was 15-ish years old), my italian (history and literature) professor changed schools and therefore we got a new one. I immediately was hooked with the way this new professor did her literature lectures (remember I initially went to a classical school?) as they weren’t boring at all: she really took her time to explain everything about the authors, their life and how they became what they were. as a result, I could say this was the first time I was really reactive in class and not just finding loopholes to keep a good grade. during that time, I was REALLY put on a pedestal.

that same year, unfortunately, one day I got caught smoking by the principal (smoking is semi-allowed in school but just as long as you don’t get caught by the principal or just someone of a higher status). I immediately got taken to his office and almost gotten a suspension (which is serious in the italian system and could stay in your “file”, therefore causing a ton of collateral issues), but I got a couple of professors who really fought for me (including my italian prof) and I managed to get out of it with simply a warning to not do anything like that again.

after that, my italian prof told me privately that they use a private balcony to go smoking and that I could go there as long as it’s just me. looking back I think this was the first instance where I felt like something was a really good gesture but weird.

for the rest of the year, sometimes I would see her on the balcony as well and chat and talk shit about people who wouldn’t do anything. 

now, I know this is all very vague and badly narrated but please bear with me. I will just fast forward to the final years as a couple of random events will come up to my mind: some time ago, I lost my uncle in a very unexpected/random way and it was pretty tragic. during that timeframe I was out of school for about 2-ish weeks and my professor was calling me EVERY SINGLE day to check up on how I was doing and how I should get back to studying, etc, etc. I will say that I think this was done in good faith (to be fair she did push me to do better and to focus more on what I wanted to do in the future), but still pretty weird.

my last year was pretty crazy and fun, but like any teen I started getting super anxious about my future and, as finals got closer, things got bad. my professor started doing these REALLY long, intense lectures that stressed everyone the hell out as we were all panicking about the practical stuff (what topics to study, how to pass the exam properly) and it felt like she was just ignoring that to explain more and more abstract things. it was too much. so everyone (me included) started complaining about her to the other professors. 

after that, she just stopped talking to me. i think she found out and felt betrayed. the only time we spoke again was at the final year dinner. she came up to me, apologized, and said she was just overwhelmed with our finals (how ironic, right?)

after that I just graduated and went on with my life: I had a fantastic summer (erasmus!) and then started university. at the start of uni, I learned about a loophole. with my technical diploma, I could take an exam and work as a full-time teacher, but it was the last year this was possible. and what did I do? I texted my professor. we ended up on the phone, and I asked for her advice. she was SUPER happy, she offered references, said she'd help in any way, and laughed about how funny it would be if I became her colleague.

all of this to say that in the end, I didn’t do that exam. womp.

i didn't hear from her again until may 2024. out of nowhere, one day she called me. she was definitely tipsy and i'm 100% SURE of it. she started going on about how she missed me and our class, how no one these days cares about literature. i gave her the basic update, told her i was working in IT and all that. and then she said it: "i had an ex at uni who studied computer science. but him, compared to you, he lacked the intellectual part." it completely threw me off. the conversation just kind of went along until i made up an excuse about having to go out.

about two weeks later, that same month, she texted me this (personal data hidden):

what she basically said was that she was inviting me to her birthday party, she mentioned something about it in the earlier call but I just dismissed it. my friends advised to reply coldly in order to get her off my neck, and so I did. I basically told her that I couldn’t make it.

I didn’t hear from her again until last week, she texted asking me for an urgent favor, she needed to have a pdf edited with her name instead of another professor’s (did I just forge some documents?), so I did and she thanked me saying I made her day, followed by a pic of her boat view saying “I’ll always wait for you here”:

I guess I just needed to put this all in one place to understand what this is exactly. as years pass, and as I get older, I think that something was a bit inappropriate about this. it is pretty true that I was a different kid, maybe more mature for my age or easier to talk to. but I was still a indeed a kid, and she was the adult. I hope this NEVER happens with another student.
