description: calls trigger my fight or flight reaction
---
a week ago I signed up to the gym and i've been trying to do a 360 on my general health. to start off i got put on a high calorie diet by my trainer and today is my second day following it. i feel like shit.



i will admit i am used to eating badly (i love fast food and junk food in general) but i'm not used to eating a lot. this morning started off with nearly 200 grams of cereals which killed me, as i normally don't have breakfast. then two hours later i had 150 grams of tuna and eight rice cakes. then lunch, then yogurt, and then dinner again. dinner also fucked me up pretty badly today.



then what i also noticed during the day is that i've been feeling a bit more anxious and more prone to getting angry. this became visibly clear before ending my day at work: a guy from the accounting department asked for a call. he is really nice to me but a pain in the ass when he asks for a feature or automation his department needs. so i hopped on a call and for some reason i think i either got anxious (i did a pretty heavy feature a few months back that had issues and i do not ever want to work on it again) or angry (why are you calling me at this time??????). i eventually figured as he was explaining that he needed something pretty easy for me to do so i was pretty chill after that. i think my problem comes whenever i have to speak with a higher up or generally anyone above me, that is when my impostor syndrome runs high. 



anyway, i'm still feeling a bit weird. my dad mentioned that i may have something like a sugar timeout (best way I could translate it), meaning that as i'm having less sugar my serotonin is dipping. i hope i can get used to this new habit of overeating and then killing myself twice, once at work and once at the gym.
