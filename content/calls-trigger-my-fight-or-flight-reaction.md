i don’t think I’ve ever procrastinated something as much as getting my drivers license. everyone, including my friends, parents and grandparents, are telling me to go get it. they all got theirs as soon as they could, and my argument has always been: “\*ah, I don’t need it, I live in a big city… I can take the subway, bus, go by bike …\*” and honestly, so far I’ve never really needed one. I go to work by bike every day and it’s perfectly doable. in my free time I use public transport or my e-bike if I have to go somewhere.



but then again, I also feel a bit behind. everyone is getting their license before me and I know it could come in handy. what if I ever want to rent a car abroad, is what they say. or what if I ever change jobs and it's too far to go by bike?



anyways, I don’t even have my theoretical part because: I'm lazy and I am a pro procastinator. let alone the practical exam: it just feels like extra stress, especially if I were to practice it in the city.



for the few times I’ve actually driven a car, it went pretty smooth. my grandparents once took me to an industrial area where there’s not a lot of traffic so I could practice in their automatic transmission car and that felt easy enough. but then some other day they took me to a friend of them who still has an old manual t ransmission car, and it was horrible. I tried to start the car multiple times and just couldn’t get it to work. I know every car is a little bit different of course, but I just felt embarrassed that I wasted their time. the car even started to smell funny because of the clutch pedal.



I’ve been telling myself every single year: "\*ok, this year I’ll get my drivers license\*. and now we’re 8 years further and nothing has changed. maybe next year I'll get it :)
